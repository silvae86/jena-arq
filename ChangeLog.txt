ChangeLog for ARQ
=================

ARQ 2.1
-------

+ Cost-based optimizer for basic graph patterns on in-memory graphs. 
  ** Uses the version of jena shipped with this release, can't use an earlier one.   

+ Convert algebra expressions back into a SPARQL query (see OpToSyntax).

+ Old "NodeToLabelMap" => "NodeIsomorphismMap"
  Affects Element and Op ".equalTo" operation signature.

+ Added extension : a graph pattern SERVICE <serviceEndPoint> { pattern }
  ARQ syntax only.
  New algebra operation: OpService

+ Added SSE to the main codebase : http://jena.hpl.hp.com/wiki/SSE

+ Internal changes: the core engines are now Graph/DatasetGraph/Algebra-centric 
  and there are classes to map betwen that and the Model/Dataset.
  QueryEngine construction and extension need not know about
  the upper layers now.

+ Algebra operator implment .hashCode() and .equals() based on structure/value equality

+ Legacy query engine1 removed.

+ Add new algebra operations
  OpGroupAgg, OpNull
  
+ VarsMentionedVisitor removed - convert to an algebra expression and use OpVars.allVars instead.

ARQ 2.0
-------

This version uses the SPARQL algebra directly,
then produces an execution scheme that uses streaming
execution where possible.

+ SPARQL changes
  + Prefixed names can now start with a digit.  ex:123 is now a legal prefix name.
  + The working group has removed attributes "ordered" and "distinct" from the
    XML Results format. These have been removed in this release.  ARQ will read
    old style XML files (and ignore the attributes).
    JSON result format also updated.

+ Multiple query engines:
  + Main query engine for optimization and efficient execution
  + Reference engine for checking functionality
    (implements the SPARQL evaluation semantics very simply for clarity and validation)
  + Remote access engine for querying SPARQL endpoints over HTTP.
  + Engine1, for exact ARQ1 semantics and enhancements
    (deprecated for new applications (and will be removed sometime))
  + RDQL engine
  + See also SDB - an ARQ query engine that for RDF stored in SQL databases 

+ Access and extension points:
   + Filter functions
   + Property functions
   + The parsed syntax
   + Generation of the SPARQL algebra expression
     + Modification of SPARQL algebra expression before executin plan generation
     + Custom algebra operations 
   + Basic graph pattern replacement or modification
     for access to other data sources
   + Modular query engine class hierarchy for reuse of machinary,
     resulting in less extra coding for extensions.
 
 + Internal changes
   + Package reorganisation
     Implemnentation in com.hp.hpl.jena.sparql
   + Filter functions now take a Context, not an ExecutionContext.
   + Deprecate "EXT" form from ARQ.
     (Property functions are better)
     
 + Experimental SPARQL/Update API
   See http://jena.hpl.hp.com/~afs/SPARQL-Update.html

Post ARQ-2.0-beta: 
+ Added REDUCED as per DAWG decision 2007-03-20
+ OpDistinct and OpReduce no longer take a variable list
+ Removed ElementExtension/PlanExtension and extension package
  The ARQ(beyond SPARQL feature) of "EXT" has been removed.
  Element visitors may be affected.
+ Added an update API
+ LARQ
	+ added access to the match score
	+ added limits on score or number of results as part of Lucene search
