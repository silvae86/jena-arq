==== ARQ 2.1 beta

ARQ 2.1 beta is a complete implementation of SPARQL including
support for custom filter function, property functions
and free text search.  It also provides an update language
based on SPARQL.

We are actively seeking feedback on the new query optimizer.  Please
let us know if it works for you so we can move from beta to full release.

I'd like to thank Markus for his work on the optimizer for ARQ.

== Cost-based Optimizer 

The ARQ-2.1-beta release includes a static cost-based optimizer for
Basic Graph Patterns for in-memory models. The optimizer uses heuristics
to estimate the execution cost of triple patterns and reorders the patterns
of a BGP according to their estimated costs. The optimizer is enabled by
default in ARQ but may be disabled if this should be required.

Please refer to the documentation for further information.

We are actively seeking feedback about the optimizer. Please don't hesitate to send us any comments or problems.

== Remote query support

The ARQ query language, an extension of SPARQL, includes the ability
to call a remote SPARQL service using the SERVICE form.  

  SERVICE <serviceEndPoint> { pattern }
  
The pattern is sent to and executed at the remote service.  ARQ combines the
results with the locally part of the query.  The algebra supports a new
operation, OpService, for this.  Algebra expression can be turned back into
SPARQL query syntax.
